  content: "G: Good morning Gary. \\nP: Hello Chief. How are you? \\nG: Oh, I am fine.
    How are YOU? Sounds like you\u2019re sober this time around. At least you\u2019re
    not slurring like last week. \\nP: Uh, hehe. Yeah what happened last week was
    quite unfortunate. But at least the party was amazing huh? \\nG: Very funny Gary.
    Listen, you know that this case is your last chance to prove yourself? \\nP: Sure\u2026
    So what happened here? \\nG: A man, Mike Hill, was found burned to death in his
    shed. We want you to take a look at the crime scene. I know it\u2019s not easy
    to solve this case in one day. But you\u2019ve done it before! I believe in you.
    So, don\u2019t disappoint me. \\nP: I\u2019ll do my best. "
